netbenchmark_1.1.0
    - First version of the netbenchmark package
    For a given list of network inference algorithms, \code{netbenchmark} 
    performs a benchmark between them. It makes use of four different big gene 
    datasources, it relies on a random subsampling of each one of the 
    datasource and noise addition in order to generate the datasets.
